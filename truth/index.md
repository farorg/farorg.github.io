# Statement
- Context Matters.  
- Pro(Onto) Graming (To formalize a nuance of peace of state) is Grammar Editing for computing system (computer)  
  *So we are writers in computer instructions, right*  
- Coding / En(Into) Coding

## Engineering / Physics / Electronics
- Everything is physical  
- Electronics are analog  
- Analog is continuous  
- Continuous values map to float in math  
- Float is the math position of analog  
- Electricity has noise  
- Heat affects signals  
- Ions flip bits  
- Cosmic radiation exists  
- Hardware is imperfect  
- Transistors are voltage thresholds  
- No true 0 or 1 in physics  
- Binary exists for noise tolerance  
- Binary is an engineering choice  
- Binary is not reality  

---

## Math / Computation
- Math means compute  
- Compute means work  
- Computers perform computation  
- Computation is math  
- Binary is discrete math  
- Float is continuous math approximation  
- Float cannot be exact in binary  
- Floats require approximation  
- Floats introduce rounding  
- Floats introduce nondeterminism  
- Integers are whole numbers  
- Integers are exact  
- Integers map directly to binary  
- Fixed-width integers are deterministic  
- Discrete math fits digital machines  
- Hex is a representation of binary  
- Base systems are representations  
- Layers exist to encode data  

---

## Logic / Foundations
- AND is a pattern  
- OR is a pattern  
- NOT is a pattern  
- XOR is a pattern  
- Logic gates build computation  
- Logic gates come from math  
- If is a pattern  
- If is a logical construct  
- Function is a pattern  
- Function has input and output  
- Parameter is a variable  
- Variable is data  
- Constant is data  
- While is a loop  
- While is the oldest loop  
- For is a loop  
- Loops are patterns  
- Everything reduces to logic  

---

## Patterns
- Everything is a pattern  
- Problems are patterns  
- Solutions are patterns  
- Behavior is pattern  
- Thought is pattern  
- Reaction is pattern  
- Systems repeat patterns  

---

## Software / System Design
- Software forgets foundations  
- Software overcomplicates abstractions  
- Software blames hardware  
- Software makes devices slow  
- Updates add unnecessary features  
- Features consume RAM  
- Bad code consumes RAM  
- Old devices are not bad  
- Devices become slow because of software  
- Optimization keeps devices alive  
- Modular updates are correct  
- Full rewrites are destructive  
- Change should be modular  
- Change should be partial  
- Failure should be partial  
- Systems should degrade gracefully  
- Backups are required  
- Learn before changing  
- Understand before updating  
- Touch to learn  
- Do not touch foundations  
- Preserve what already works  

---

## Application Design
- Electron is a web viewer  
- Electron is not native  
- Electron overcomplicates  
- Web viewers exist in many languages  
- Python has web viewers  
- Java has web viewers  
- C has web viewers  
- Wrapper is a misleading term  
- Wrapper hides complexity  
- Wrapper pretends to be native  

---

## Web
- Web is files  
- HTML is a file  
- CSS is a file  
- JavaScript is a file  
- Website is file delivery  
- Server is a computer  
- Server reads files  
- Server writes files  
- CDN is file replication  
- Everything is local  
- Network sends local files to other machines  

---

## Network / Protocol
- Network is communication  
- Communication is data transfer  
- Data transfer is read and write  
- GET is read  
- POST is write  
- PUT is edit  
- DELETE is delete  
- Everything reduces to read and write  

---

## HTTP / HTTPS
- HTTP is file transfer  
- HTTPS is HTTP with encoding (encryption)  
- Encryption is encoding and decoding  
- Encoding and decoding require input  
- Input is a key  
- Key is also encoded and decoded  
- HTTPS is still HTTP  
- HTTPS badge is not absolute security  
- Security is process  
- Security is not a boolean  

---

## Browser / Device Support
- Software should work on all devices  
- Software should work on old devices  
- Software should not target only Chrome  
- Apple devices must be supported  
- Linux must be supported  
- Small devices must be supported  
- Old browsers still matter  
- Full-screen button creates app-like feel  
- Looking modern is not functionality  
- PWAs are not the point  
- Appearance does not equal reliability  

---

## Java / JVM / Runtime
- Java claims write once run anywhere  
- Java requires JVM  
- JVM is a dependency  
- Without JVM it does not run  
- Dependencies break portability  
- Web runs with built-in interpreters  
- Browsers already exist on devices  

---

## AI / Computing Models
- AI should respect hardware  
- AI should be discrete  
- AI should avoid floats  
- AI should use whole numbers  
- Fixed states are faster  
- Discrete AI is stable  
- Float-based AI is fragile  
- Quantized models are efficient  
- Integer-based AI runs faster  
- Determinism matters  

---

- Emotions follow patterns  

---

## Reality
