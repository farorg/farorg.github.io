This table presents the core structure of the Modern Measurement for Intelligence framework. It identifies five main cognitive areas: Creative, Feeling, Logical, Practical, and Musical. Each area is connected to specific brain regions and associated with distinct cognitive functions.

The purpose of the table is to show that intelligence is not limited to one function or location in the brain. Instead, each part works with memory in a unique way. Memory is treated as a built-in process in every area, supporting how we receive, store, process, and respond to information.


## Overview
This research introduces a modern framework for evaluating intelligence as a distributed system within the brain. Rather than viewing intelligence as a single measurable trait, it breaks it down into five key cognitive domains: Creative, Feeling, Logical, Practical, and Musical.

Each domain is associated with specific brain regions and cognitive functions, and all are supported by integrated memory processes. Memory is not treated as a separate system, but as a core function within each domain enabling input, storage, processing, and output of data.

The goal of this model is to provide a simplified yet scientifically grounded structure for understanding both human and artificial intelligence. It is designed to be accessible across disciplines, useful in educational settings, and adaptable for future development in cognitive frameworks. Most importantly, this model can be distributed as a basis for measuring IG (Intelligence Graphical) a broader, multi domain representation of intelligence. Unlike traditional IQ (Intelligence Quotient), which primarily measures logical and analytical abilities, IG captures the full range of cognitive functions including creativity, emotion, practical skills, and musical intelligence.


 - A framework for evaluating intelligence (Could help in AI or human).
 - Focuses on modern metrics for cognitive/computational
  capabilities in which identified as form of the Life of
  Intelligence within a entity.
